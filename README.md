# VetAgent

## Veterinary Agent Driven LLM

#### With the rise of OPENAI API there are a number of products that simply function as API wrappers with custom prompts and at best simply charge for what ChatGPT could do for free. This repro serves as a place where I can build a tool to support business and medical care processes at a toy level to understand unique challenges, opportunities, and ideas that come to my mind.

- The initial repo leverages OPENAPI as langchain has not yet release agent support for OLLAMA/ LLAMA3. Future work may connvert to this functionality.
